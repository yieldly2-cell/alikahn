Build a highly secure USDT investment platform 'Yieldly' with the following strict rules:
🔐 Account Creation & Login Security
Real Email Only:
User must verify email via 6-digit OTP sent from yieldly@gmail.com
Block temporary emails (@temp-mail.org, @10minutemail.com, etc.)
If fake email → no OTP → account not created
One Device, One Account:
On first signup, capture unique Device ID (using device_info_plus)
Same device cannot create multiple accounts
Different device + same email = allowed (but logs warning)
Strict Login Policy:
After logout, user must use the same email and password used during signup
Any other email/password → error: "Invalid credentials. Use your registered email."
📧 OTP Flow (From yieldly@gmail.com)
User enters email → clicks "Send OTP"
System sends 6-digit code to that email via SMTP (Gmail)
User enters code in app → if valid → account created
OTP expires in 10 minutes, max 3 attempts
💳 Deposit Process (Manual Approval)
User sees wallet: TLfixnZVqzmTp2UhQwHjPiiV9eK3NemLy7 + QR
Must upload:
TXID (Tronscan link)
Screenshot proof (showing sender, receiver, amount, timestamp)
Status: "Pending Admin Approval"
❌ NO auto-credit — admin must review screenshot in panel
Admin approves → balance added + referral logic triggered
⏳ Investment Timer
After deposit approval, user clicks "Start Investment"
72-hour countdown begins (server-side cron job)
Timer shown on dedicated screen with progress bar
At 72h:
10% profit added to user
Referral commission (1–3%) auto-added to referrers
👥 Referral System
Referral code: 8-digit alphanumeric (e.g., A3B9K2M8)
