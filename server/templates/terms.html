      <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
      <p class="effective-date">Effective Date: February 12, 2026</p>
    </div>

    <p>Welcome to Yieldly. By accessing or using the Yieldly platform ("Platform"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). Please read them carefully before using our services. If you do not agree with any part of these Terms, you must discontinue use of the Platform immediately.</p>

    <h2>1. Nature of the Platform</h2>
    <p>Yieldly is a <strong>tracking and analytics platform only</strong>. Yieldly does not hold, manage, custody, or control any user funds at any time. The Platform provides a user interface for tracking USDT (TRC-20) deposits, investments, referral activity, and withdrawal requests. All fund transfers occur directly between users and the designated Trust Wallet. Yieldly does not operate as a bank, financial institution, exchange, or licensed money transmitter.</p>

    <h2>2. USDT Deposits</h2>
    <p>All USDT deposits must be sent as <strong>TRC-20 tokens on the TRON network</strong> to the following designated Trust Wallet address:</p>
    <p><span class="wallet-address">TLfixnZVqzmTp2UhQwHjPiiV9eK3NemLy7</span></p>

    <div class="warning-box">
      <p>Sending USDT or any other cryptocurrency via any network other than TRC-20 (including but not limited to ERC-20, BEP-20, SOL, or any other blockchain network) will result in permanent and irreversible loss of funds. Yieldly bears no responsibility for funds sent to incorrect networks or addresses.</p>
    </div>

    <p>The minimum deposit amount is <strong>$5 USDT</strong>. After making a deposit, users must submit the following proof through the Platform:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The <strong>Transaction ID (TXID)</strong> from the blockchain transaction</li>
      <li>A <strong>screenshot</strong> of the completed transaction as visual confirmation</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All deposits are subject to <strong>manual verification and approval by the Yieldly administrator</strong>. Deposits are not automatically credited. The administrator will verify the TXID on the TRON blockchain and review the submitted screenshot before approving the deposit. Deposit approval times may vary.</p>

    <h2>3. Investment Cycle</h2>
    <p>Upon approval of a deposit, an investment cycle begins automatically. Each investment cycle operates on a <strong>72-hour (3-day) fixed period</strong>. The yield rate applied to each cycle is determined by your current yield rate at the time the investment begins. At maturation (after exactly 72 hours), the original deposit amount plus the earned profit is credited to your available balance on the Platform.</p>
    <p>The base yield rate is <strong>10% per 72-hour cycle</strong>. This rate may be increased through the referral program as described in Section 5 below. Yield rates are locked at the start of each investment cycle and cannot be changed mid-cycle.</p>

    <h2>4. Withdrawals</h2>
    <p>Users may request a withdrawal of their available balance at any time, subject to the following conditions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The minimum withdrawal amount is <strong>$20 USDT</strong></li>
      <li>Users must provide a valid <strong>TRC-20 USDT wallet address</strong> for receiving funds</li>
      <li>All withdrawals are <strong>processed manually by the administrator</strong></li>
      <li>Processing times may vary depending on verification and operational requirements</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Yieldly reserves the right to request additional verification before processing any withdrawal. Withdrawals to incorrect or invalid wallet addresses are irreversible, and Yieldly assumes no liability for user-provided address errors.</p>

    <h2>5. Referral Program</h2>
    <p>Yieldly offers a dynamic referral yield program that rewards users for bringing qualified participants to the Platform:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Each user receives a unique referral code upon registration</li>
      <li>A referral is considered <strong>"qualified"</strong> when the referred user makes a cumulative deposit of at least <strong>$50 USDT</strong></li>
      <li>For each qualified referral, the referring user's yield rate increases by <strong>+1% per 72-hour cycle</strong></li>
      <li>The maximum yield rate is capped at <strong>30%</strong> (base 10% + up to 20 qualified referrals)</li>
      <li>Referred users who deposit $50 or more receive an <strong>11% base yield rate</strong> (instead of 10%) and a one-time <strong>$5 welcome bonus</strong></li>
      <li>Upon reaching <strong>20 qualified referrals</strong>, the referring user receives a one-time <strong>$30 milestone bonus</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Referral bonuses and yield rate increases are applied automatically by the system upon qualification. Yieldly reserves the right to modify, suspend, or terminate the referral program at any time, with or without prior notice.</p>

    <h2>6. Account Restrictions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Each user is limited to <strong>one account per device</strong>. Device identifiers are recorded during registration to enforce this policy.</li>
      <li>Email addresses must be verified via a one-time password (OTP) during registration.</li>
      <li>Yieldly reserves the right to block or suspend accounts that violate these Terms, engage in fraudulent activity, or abuse the referral program.</li>
      <li>Use of temporary or disposable email addresses is prohibited.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Risk Disclosure</h2>
    <div class="warning-box">
      <p>Cryptocurrency investments are inherently high-risk. There are no guaranteed returns. The value of USDT and other digital assets may fluctuate, and past performance is not indicative of future results. You should only invest funds that you can afford to lose entirely.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Yieldly makes no representations or warranties regarding the profitability, safety, or suitability of any investment. Users are solely responsible for their own investment decisions and should seek independent financial advice before participating.</p>

      <li>Yieldly shall not be liable for any <strong>service interruptions, technical failures, or security breaches</strong> beyond its reasonable control.</li>

    <h2>10. Modifications to These Terms</h2>
