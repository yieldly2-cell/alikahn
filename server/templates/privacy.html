    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect exclusively for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Account creation and management</strong> &mdash; To register your account, verify your identity via email OTP, and maintain your account profile</li>
      <li><strong>Deposit and withdrawal processing</strong> &mdash; To verify and approve financial transactions through manual administrator review</li>
      <li><strong>Investment tracking</strong> &mdash; To manage 72-hour investment cycles, calculate profits based on your yield rate, and credit matured investment payouts</li>
      <li><strong>Referral program administration</strong> &mdash; To track referral activity, apply yield rate increases, and distribute referral bonuses</li>
      <li><strong>Security and fraud prevention</strong> &mdash; To enforce account restrictions, detect suspicious activity, and maintain platform integrity through device ID verification</li>
      <li><strong>Administrative auditing</strong> &mdash; To maintain audit logs of administrative actions for accountability and dispute resolution</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>Yieldly is firmly committed to protecting your personal data. Our data sharing practices are as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>We do not sell your personal data</strong> to any third party, under any circumstances.</li>
      <li><strong>We do not share your personal data</strong> with third-party companies, advertisers, marketers, or analytics providers.</li>
      <li><strong>We do not use your data for advertising</strong> or targeted marketing purposes.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Your data may only be disclosed in the following limited circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Legal requirements</strong> &mdash; If required by law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request</li>
      <li><strong>Platform protection</strong> &mdash; To enforce our Terms of Service, protect the rights, property, or safety of Yieldly, its users, or others</li>
      <li><strong>Fraud prevention</strong> &mdash; To investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected fraud, security issues, or illegal activities</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your personal information:</p>

    <div class="security-box">
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Password protection:</strong> All passwords are securely hashed using the bcrypt algorithm before storage. We never store passwords in plain text, and our administrators cannot view your password.</li>
        <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> Session management is handled through JSON Web Tokens (JWT) with secure signing, ensuring that only authenticated users can access their account data.</li>
        <li><strong>Login protection:</strong> Rate limiting is applied to login attempts to prevent brute-force attacks. Accounts are temporarily locked after multiple failed attempts.</li>
        <li><strong>Email verification:</strong> One-time passwords (OTPs) with a 10-minute expiry and limited retry attempts protect the registration process.</li>
        <li><strong>File security:</strong> Uploaded deposit screenshots are stored securely with randomized filenames to prevent unauthorized access.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>While we take reasonable measures to protect your data, no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security, and you acknowledge that you provide your information at your own risk.</p>
